#Simulation of a social network
Each social network has its own and unique features, but in general, they all follow the same basis,
for example, most social networks have a different mechanism for following each other, but Instagram is one way and LinkedIn is another.

In this project, we use tools like Git, Github, mysql, postman, python, Django, DRF implement the backend part.
